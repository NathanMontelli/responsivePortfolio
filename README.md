# responsivePortfolio
In this project I was tasked at creating a responsive portfolio while utilizing bootstrap. My website features a about me, portfolio, and contact page to provide potential future employers with prevelant information about my professional web dev capabilities.

I used bootstrap in order to provide a responsive layout that works on mutliple different platforms and devices.

one of the greatest challenenges oddly enough was getting my footer to stay on the bottom. I was able to accomplish this multiple times but after making a few changes to my code the footer would readjust and no longer be stuck to the bottom of the page. While my footer does work on each page and stick to the bottom on most devices there are still some where I cannot get the footer to stay at the bottom.
